# Week 5: Principles of data analysis: Data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization with the Pandas and Plotly Libraries

This week, we will review the principles of data wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Wrangling is the process of transforming data from a raw format into one that is legible. Cleaning entails making sure our data does not include inconsistencies such as duplicate entries or information stored in the wrong format. Analysis and visualizations are ways of telling a story with the data, and uncovering insights that may lead to new research questions. 

We will be using the Pandas and Plotly Python libraries to help us achieve our data processing goals. You can think of a Python library like software that works specifically for Python. Just like you might use Microsoft Excel for data exploration on your personal computer, in Python we have libraries like Pandas and Plotly that we can download and then import (a fancy word for open) in our Python environment. Pandas, which stands for "Python Data Analysis Library", is specifically designed for data manipulation and analysis. Plotly is a data visualization library. 

We will be using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/), an open source web application that you can use to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text.


- Topics covered:
    - Working with tabular data (a.k.a., spreadsheets)
    - The data process: wrangling, cleaning, analysis, and visualization
    - Pandas basics
    - Plotly basics
- Curriculum for this session:
    - Rebecca Krisel's [intro-pandas-dri-2022](https://github.com/rskrisel/intro-pandas-dri-2022)
    - Kaggle's [Plotly Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kanncaa1/plotly-tutorial-for-beginners/notebook)
    - DHRI: [Short Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/insights/short-introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks/)
- Assignments (due by 10am on the day of class):
    - Complete weekly assignment, which will be shared weekly on Fridays by 12pm via GitHub classroom. The weekly assignments will ask you to annotate code to explain what the code is doing, and identify errors in the code by troubleshooting it. Share the resources you found to help you explain the code and/or work through the errors. You may work in groups up to four students, but please make sure to note this on your homework assignment.
